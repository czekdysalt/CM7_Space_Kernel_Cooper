=============

For CyanoSpaceMod7 / CM7 based roms

How to compile this kernel ?

Sync the source first

then after setting up ur workspace for kernel building 

edit makefile for the correct toolchain path 

and then go to the root kernel directory 
and do ./compile 

wait after doing its build it will give u a CWM flashable zip inside CWM-ZIP directory ;)
